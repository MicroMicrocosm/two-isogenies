    A modification of

    Algorithm 60: https://sike.org/files/SIDH-spec.pdf Shown to be appropriate
    for (l,l)-chains in https://ia.cr/2023/508

    Which allows the leftmost branch to have a different cost for the rest of
    the tree. This is partiularly useful for (2,2) isogenies, where the gluing
    doubling and images have a much higher cost than the rest of the tree.
