# An Algorithmic Approach to (2, 2)-isogenies in the Theta Model

We have made some changes on the GitHub repository [two-isogenies](https://github.com/ThetaIsogenies/two-isogenies) to implement our inversion-free method. These changes are listed in [Changes](#changes). We also keep the original `README` file content in [Original](#original).

## Changes

See `./Theta-SageMath/README.md` and `./Theta-Rust/README.md`.

## Original

Code accompanying the research paper: 
[An Algorithmic Approach to (2, 2)-isogenies in the Theta Model and Applications to Isogeny-based Cryptography](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1747.pdf)
by Pierrick Dartois, Luciano Maino, Giacomo Pope, and Damien Robert.

This repository contains both a constant time implementation in Rust and an alternative implementation for SageMath. For further details and usage examples, see the respective `READMD.md` in the sub-directories `Theta-Rust` and `Theta-SageMath`.
